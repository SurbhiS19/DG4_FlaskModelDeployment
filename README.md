# DG4_FlaskModelDeployment

Model predicting California housing block prices has been deployed using the Flask framework. The web app takes median household income, average number of rooms, house age as input and estimates the price of house. The dataset that has been used for this project is “California Housing” dataset. The model is trained to predict the median house value. Every file explains different part of the project in detail.
